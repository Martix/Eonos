= How to setup and use TestBuilder

I assume below that you wish install TestBuilder into ~/testbuilder directory.

1. Copy files from OE contrib/testing/testbuilder directory to any place you
   wish to use (e.g. ~/testbuilder) and goto that directory

2. Run setup-testbuilder script with OE branch and bitbake branch you wish to
   use. E.g.:
   ./setup-testbuilder "testing-next" "1.10"
 
   It will clone OE and bitbake trees and prepare build/conf/local.conf file
   for you. You can review local.conf after and add some settings there.

4. Create testbuilder.conf according your needs.  You can use
   testbuilder.conf.sample as reference.

5. Run ./testbuilder and wait for build results. Check 'logs' subdir for log
   files ('tail logs/B.*' is useful)

You can run single configured build (e.g. "testing")
./testbuilder -B testing

Or you can use testbuilder to build specified distro/machine/image
(e.g. angstrom-2008.1/qemuarm/console-image)
./testbuilder -D angstrom-2008.1 -M qemuarm console-image

If you wish only setup environment and run bitbake by hands you can
use -S option:
./testbuilder -D angstrom-2008.1 -M qemuarm -S
